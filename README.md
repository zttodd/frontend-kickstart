# Front-end Kickstart  

## Get a simple front-end project up and running quickly.  

**Getting Started**  

- Run `npm install` to get all required gulp plugins.  
- Run `gulp` to build the scripts and styles, and listen for changes in `src`.  

**Scripts**  

- Include any scripts within `src/js`.  
- All scripts are concatenated, and both minified and unminified scripts are generated.

**Styles**  

- Write styles within `site.scss`.  
- Create a `partials` directory (example: `src/scss/partials`) and import created partials into `site.scss`.
